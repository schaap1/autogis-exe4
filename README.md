# Exercise 4


This week we will practice how to conduct data classification and aggregation using geopandas. Last week in exercise 3 we analyzed buffer zones around shopping centers. This week we will take into account travel distances using data from the [Helsinki Region Travel Time Matrix](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/accessibility/helsinki-region-travel-time-matrix/).

The overall aim this week is to define dominance areas [0] for 8 shopping centers in Helsinki with different travel modes (Public tranport, private car). Finally, we will find out how many people live within the dominance areas of those shopping centers.

[0]: Here, we define the dominance area of a service as the geographical area from where the given service (shopping center) is the closest one to reach in terms of travel time.

- **This exercise is due by Thursday the 26th of November at 5pm** (day before the next practical session).
- You can gain **20** from this exercise.
